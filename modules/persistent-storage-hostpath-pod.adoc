= Mounting the hostPath share in a Pod

After the PersistentVolumeClaim has been created, it can be used inside by an application. The following example demonstrates mounting this share inside of a Pod.

.Prerequisites
* A PersistentVolumeClaim exists that is mapped to the underlying hostPath share.

.Procedure

* Create a Pod that mounts the existing PersistentVolumeClaim:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-name <1>
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data <2>
      name: hostpath-volume
  ...
  securityContext: {}
  volumes:
    - name: hostpath-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pvc-volume <3>
----
<1> The name of the Pod.
<2> The path to mount the hostPath share inside the privileged Pod.
<3> The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that has been previously created.
